# py-coreutils

A coreutils collection writing in python3

## Preparation

Make sure that python3 is already installed, and `/usr/bin/env` can find the interpreter.

## How to use them?

Give the \*.py excute permission, and then run it. I try my best to make the python edition has the same usage and behavior as the GNU edition.

## Coding style

PEP8.
