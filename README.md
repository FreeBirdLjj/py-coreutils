# py-coreutils

A coreutils collection writing in python3

## Preparation

Make sure that python3 is already installed, and the interpreter is at `/usr/bin/python3`.

## How to use them?

Give the *.py excute permission, and then run it. I try my best to make the python edition has the same usage and behavior as the GNU edition.
